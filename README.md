# Your team has learned that people are frustrated with google maps.  You have been giving 10 million dollars (in monopoly money 😊) of Venture Capital to write “Gladys Map” an app that utilizes GPS data for a Start Up company your team has created.  The application asks the user for a current position (x,y) and a destination position (x,y) and computes the distance between the two locations using mathematics created by the legendary Dr. Gladys West.
